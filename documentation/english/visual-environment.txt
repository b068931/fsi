By definition an IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. 
An IDE typically consists of a source code editor, build automation tools, and a debugger.
fsi-visual-environment is not an IDE, as it does not provide all the features typically associated with an IDE. Hence, the term
"visual environment" is used instead. Because it provides a visual interface for some of the tools that FSI has.

The main features of fsi-visual-environment include:
- A simple code editor, along with file browsing capabilities.
- Some level of integration with FSI translator (see use-fsi-translator.txt) for more information.
- Some level of integration with FSI mediator (see use-fsi-mediator.txt) for more information.
- Translations into English and Ukrainian languages.
- Themes support (light and dark themes).

After installing the FSI you'll have several directories and files in the installation folder:
- 'bin'          : Contains the FSI executables and all the necessary DLLs. Check "installation.txt" for more details.
- 'documentation': Contains the documentation files, including this one.
- 'examples'     : Contains example scripts. Refer to "use-fsi-translator.txt" and "use-fsi-mediator" for more details.
- 'libraries'    : Contains the libraries that you might use in your scripts. Notice that right now there is only one.
- 'LICENSE.txt'  : Licensing information about the FSI. Read that if you want to modify the FSI or use its parts in your own projects.
- 'README.md'   : A short introduction.
- 'vc_redist.x64.exe' : The VC++ Redistributable installer. This is only needed if you used the ".msi" installer, 
                        and you don't have VC++ Redist installed. REFER TO "LICENSE.txt" FOR MORE DETAILS.

The 'bin' folder contains all of the compiled executables and DLLs that are needed to run the FSI. Depending on the installation
type it might also contain the VC++ Redist files. REFER TO "LICENSE.txt" FOR MORE DETAILS. The high-level description of each of
the EE's (Execution Engine) modules is provided in the "README.md". All executables are prefixed with "fsi-", so that they do not
clash with other executables in you PATH, should you choose to add the 'bin' folder to your PATH.

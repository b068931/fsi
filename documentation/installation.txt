Refer to "release-layout.txt" for the layout of the release package.
There are two ways to install the From Scratch Interpreter (FSI):
1. Using the installer, which is packaged as two files:
   - 'fsi-installer.msi' installs ONLY the software itself.
   - 'setup.exe' checks whether you have VC++ Redistributable installed 
   and installs it if necessary, then installs the software.

2. Using the portable version, which is packaged as a ZIP file.
The only difference between the two is that the portable version includes
all the necessary VC++ Redist files in the 'bin' folder. However, they can't be
updated automatically, so Microsoft discourages this approach - I do not care.
So if you are using a portable version, you don't have to do anything except
extract the ZIP file to a folder of your choice.

If you get error message boxes with scary text about missing DLLs, you are probably missing
VC++ Redist. Most likely, this is because you used the ".msi" installer. For this reason,
I also added "vc_redist.x64.exe" in the root folder, it'll install the VC++ Redist.

If the messages persist, but you have VC++ Redist installed, and these messages appear inside
the CMD window, then it is quite likely that the execution engine's modules got borked. Another
possibility is that the '.mods' file got corrupted. Either way, try reinstalling. Or use
the portable version.
